## Description
This project is focused on understanding and implementing JavaScript Promises. You'll learn how to use the `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods, as well as how to work with async functions and the `await` operator. The goal is to be able to explain Promises and their usage in JavaScript without relying on external resources.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:
- Promises: how, why, and what they are.
- How to use the `then`, `resolve`, and `catch` methods.
- How to use every method of the `Promise` object.
- The `throw` and `try` statements for error handling.
- The `await` operator.
- How to use an `async` function.
