# 0x03. ES6 Data Manipulation

## Description
This project focuses on manipulating data structures in JavaScript using ES6 features. You'll explore various methods and data structures such as arrays, typed arrays, sets, and maps. The project will enhance your understanding of these features and their practical applications in handling and transforming data efficiently.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` functions on arrays.
- Work with typed arrays.
- Understand and manipulate `Set`, `Map`, and `WeakMap` data structures.

## Requirements
- All files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x.
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the `.js` extension.
- Your code will be tested using `Jest` and the command `npm run test`.
- Your code will be verified against lint using `ESLint`.
- Your code needs to pass all the tests and lint checks. You can verify the entire project by running `npm run full-test`.
- All of your functions must be exported.
